            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            
            <p>
                We analyzed the response time data to verify if the result meets our hypothesis that by using a smart lamp it will be less time consuming and more 
                accessible than using a standard lamp.
            </p>
			
            <p>
                From our findings at short distances (test 1) the lamps are similar in time to use, with the normal lamp on average 4.48 seconds compared to the smart 
                lamp at 4.73 seconds. This trend is also reflected with test 2 with yet again the normal lamp being faster by a larger margin. Looking into the final test, 
                test 3 which the distance was greatly increased to 3 metres from 1. The uses of the smart lamp starts to show as on average is two seconds faster than the normal 
                lamp.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Regarding smart lamps, it can be identified that there is no relation with the distance or position this makes sense as it is all about using an application on the 
                phone and no physical movement beyond the screen is necessary.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This explains the reason that controlling a smart lamp take slightly more time than that of a normal lamp in Test 1 and 2 (when the participant is sitting or standing 1
                meter away from the lamps) but it is about 67% faster in Test 3 (when the participant is standing 3 meters away from the lamps). The result matches our hypothesis to 
                some extent that the smart lamp is more advantageous in terms of time consuming when the person is not around the lamp.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Comparing the data to the Hypothesis put forward before the tests, it would prove correct in longer distances or possibly environments which are tricky to 
                navigate across. While in short distances the normal lamp is a quicker option. This could change over time as technology advances and become faster and more user friendly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On the second portion of the Hypothesis the application / smart lamp did become faster than the normal lamp and would be able to be completed in much fewer steps,
                with less time spent than the normal lamp.
            </p>
            
            <p>We also found some other facts in terms of smart lamp impression from subjects, outliers that might have affected results and suggestions to improve the app.</p>
            
            <p>
                Figure 4 shows that half of subjects find the turn on and off the smart-lamp and well as changing the brightness with the app feel extremely easy while the other half 
                find it medium to difficult to use. This group of data might be related to the fact that 50% of the participants had never used the smart-light technology before. However,
                despite the above fact that half of the participants do not consider the app effortless, it can be seen in Figure 6 that 83.3% of the subjects are considering buying a 
                smart-lamp while the remaining last subject is undecided instead of rejecting to use it. The majority of subjects show interest in having their own smart lamps.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                There are a few outliers that have affected the results the most noticeable would be during test 1 of the smart lamp participant 3 took 7.25 seconds affecting the average
                 by added about 0.5 of a second. Another noticeable outlier would be during test 2 of the smart lamps which participant took 8.03 seconds to complete the task having around 
                 another 0.5 seconds to the average. If this participants result is considered as an exception and the data is removed then the new average is calculated the new result would 
                 be 4.73 Seconds instead of the original average of 5.32 Seconds. This is a more accurate estimation as it is around the same data as the other tests smart lamp trial.
            </p>
			
            <p>
                From what we could tell this noticeable outliers only affect the smart lamp tests, which could reflect trouble with the application. Such as starting, 
                freezing or just the phone being slow. Having a larger participant pool would help further prove if these are just generic outliers or a common occurrence 
                between the user and the application.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In terms of UX design, from Figure 5, two out of three suggestions we received are related to the app designing - “change the brightness and colour temperature adjusting
                 settings” and “make the user instruction more beginner friendly such as showing the step-by-step instruction in bigger layouts”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Last but not the least, Figure 3 indicates that the nearly 1.8 times the price of a normal lamp can be one factor influencing consumer’s decision to buy a smart lamp as
                 one of the subjects consider the price unfair.
            </p>
