			<p>TODO: Experiments and Method Section</p>
            
            <p><strong>Subjects:</strong> 5 to 8 people who are familiar with smartphone use have volunteered to participate in our experiment. 
                All of them were capable smartphone users, with the ability to touch an app icon proficiently, as well as navigate an app they have not used before.</p>
                      
            <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> To complete the experiment the team will need the following items.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A Smart Phone with the ‘Xiaomi Home Application’ loaded on the device</li>
                <li>A Xiaomi Smart-Lamp/ Smart Light</li>
                <li>A Standard Desktop Lamp with a physical on/ off switch</li>
                <li>Desk</li>
                <li>Clear space of at least 3 metres that a subject can move around</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Background / Methodology:</strong></p>
           
            <p>
                <strong>Type of Test:</strong> The team will commence an informal summative test. The results will be gathered at the end of the test, with a survey which the test subject will be
                 asked to fill out. The test will be done in an informal situation as the people the team will be using are all friends or family members who volunteered and a formal 
                 situation would be hard to commit to. When gathering data the teams understanding of the difference between quantitative data and qualitative data is that quantitative 
                 data is data typically a number which can be modeled. While qualitative data is data which are more words based and harder to represent with a chart or graphic. 
                 (Punch, 2014)
            </p>

            <p>
                The team has decided to follow a mixed approach where the team will gather quantitative data in the way of time taken to turn on a lamp, and qualitative data through
                 asking for users impressions and recommendations for improvement to the lamp or application. This approach should also be improved by having between 5 to 8 subjects who 
                 will be asked 16-20 detailed questions after the test. We believe that will be a good sample size as its enough where we can get a good average while still being a small
                  number of people so the team can take their time with asking the detailed questions in the survey.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Testing Conditions:</strong> The test will be run in a space allowing for movement, with a one by three metre rectangle marked out. The distance will be measured 
                by a table/ desk that the desktop lamp and smart lamp will be on top of. The subjects time to turn on the lamp will be recorded and used as a measurement metric.            
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Recruitment Method:</strong> All test subjects will be friends or family of the testing team as they are typically the only available for the team to use when 
                testing occurs. The test subjects must be between the ages of 19 and 26. They are then chosen depending on their availability in relation to the teams testing sessions
                 times.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Length and Format of Sessions:</strong> We define a session as one experiment with one test subject. The session will have 3 Tests and 1 Survey which the test
                 subject must complete. Each session is expected to take around 10 to 20 minutes including learning/ practice time of the Xiaomi Home application. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>Session Walkthrough:</strong> The following is a walkthrough of all the steps which will be completed and observed during a session with a test subject. </p>

            <ol>
                <li>The subject is introduced to the experiment where they are told we are testing the usability of the Xiaomi Smart Lamp.</li>

                <li>The subject is provided with a phone with the loaded application. They are then told to ‘have a play around’ with the application and then to tell the tester when they
                     are ready to continue.
                </li>

                <li>Once the subject tries the application and is ready to continue. The tests start. Each session has three tests each test has two trials one where the subject turns on
                     the standard lamp and the second where the subject turns on the smart lamp. The only changes between each test are the distance or starting position of the subject. 
                </li>

                <li>Test 1 starts with the subject sitting down one meter away from the lamps. The first trial they are asked to turn on the smart lamp, their time is recorded then they 
                    begin trial 2. Trial two is the same as trial one however they are turning on the standard lamps. The time taken is recorded for comparison later on. 
                </li>

                <li>Test 2 is the same as test 1 however the subject is standing one meter away.</li>

                <li>Test 3 is where the subject is in a sitting position three meters away from the lamps. The trials then follow the same steps as the two previous tests.</li>

                <li>Once the tests have been completed the subject is given a survey which asks them about their experience with the smart lamp and the Xiaomi Home app.</li>
            </ol>
