            <p>
                I am currently in my last year of working towards my Bachelor of Computer and Information Science majoring in Software Development. Overall I have found the course
                an interesting experience and learnt a large number of different programming languages some of these languages include Java, Dart, SQL and PHP as well as many other 
                languages and key programs which will I feel will definitely support me in the careers.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have found that doing this paper, Human-Computer Interactions has provided me with a different more design based view of User Interface development as well as how 
                users can interact with a computing system. This makes me feel more confident and obligated to question and review my development processes when it comes to creating
                user interfaces. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                With assignment 2 the team decided to test the Xiaomi Smart-Lamp and its corresponding mobile application ‘Xiaomi Home’. This was an interesting technology to trial 
                because it is a recent technology that can be linked to smart devices like Alexia and Google Home as well as the recent insurgence of the technology means that it 
                is being used by more and more people.
            </p>

            <p>
                Personally, I have very limited experience in using smart technology or phone application linked phones however recently after a few other friends have picked up other 
                brands of smart light bulbs I thought I would give on a go. Therefore I only have around one to two week with using the Xiaomi Smart lamp however I have found that this 
                lamp is very fun to use and useful. Especially with the blue light limiter light which I use while on my PC. When I use this setting I have found that it has been helping 
                me with getting to sleep directly after using my computer. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The whole team worked on everything together. I was responsible for creating the google forms survey as well as setting up and recording the test. We then as a team wrote 
                up the results and gave all our impressions. I found that while doing this experiment that it was interesting how hard some subjects found using Xiaomi home which I found 
                really easy to use and learn. Another interesting point which only came to me after the testing was how the subjects all seemed unaware of possible security risks having a 
                technology which connects to your internet can be and could be a backdoor into a network. This is something that if I was to complete this experiment again I would like to 
                look into more.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I feel overall the experiment was an interesting test which gave some interesting results I think that there are definitely lots of places where the team and myself 
                could improve to make the assignment easier to complete and possibly give better more valid results. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The first aspect is being that we should have started to gather results and planning the tests earlier. The team was formed around 2-3 Weeks into semester 2 as I initially 
                wanted to try the assignment by myself, However, the more I saw the workload the more I thought a group would be better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Next, the team needed better communication. I should also be considered part of this fault as well as there would be weeks where the team would have 0 communication in the 
                group chat and I feel that this may have slightly affected our experiment and approach by delaying time. If I was to do this again I think that I should maybe initiate more 
                conversations and messages among the group so everyone is on the same page. I started doing this near the end of the project however I still feel it may have been too late.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall though, The team has been able to provide results and experiment which I am happy with,  besides the improvements which could have been made I feel that this paper 
                and assignment has given me a very interesting learning experience which I feel will help me later on in my career depending on where I end up.
            </p>
