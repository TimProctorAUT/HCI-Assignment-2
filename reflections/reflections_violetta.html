            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>            
            <p>
                HCI is driven by the creation of high-level user interface design focused on user needs. The industry continually changes, for this reason, as developers, we must be 
                highly adaptable to meet end-user requirements to deliver the best product we can. <br>
                I am specialized in Software Development, but at the same time I pay attention to web/UI design. UI development plays a critical role in software design, as well as 
                affects other digital industries. The most important thing is to make design easy-to-use meaning intuitive, so the user doesn’t have to spend much time for learning interface 
                before using it. UI also gets driven by data, in such a way, our group assignment is proved to be a controlled experiment with the purpose of collecting data in order to receive 
                feedback on smart lighting systems.
            </p>
			
            <p><strong>Usability Test</strong></p>            
            <p>
                The purpose of this research study has been to look at the smart lighting technology, how comfortable and easy it is to use the smart home app, as well as how much time it 
                takes to lamp to respond to what user want it to be done.<br> 
                We were conducting usability test using both quantitative and qualitative approaches as we wanted to combine different types of survey questions and result the data into 
                relevant findings. I added several questions to the survey list as I thought it would help to make it more informal while obtaining more information on participants’ thoughts 
                about smart technologies.
                During the experiment I found that most of the participants spent in average 5-8 minutes on learning the manual book, however they were familiar with this technology before. 
                Testing the smart home app was challenging as I faced that application interface which seemed to be obvious to me, was hard to determine to another person. The test was quite 
                successful, 
                and I’ve gained a little experience by checking for distance and counting response time. We also asked couple questions related to personalized opinions. It was revealed that 
                the majority would prefer to buy a smart device in future.<br>
                Some of the participants mentioned that the app was well-designed and easy to follow. Good layout and icon design make the app attractive to use. Therefore, the participants 
                are more likely to return and use this app again.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>			
            <p>
                I believe smart home innovations will accelerate the growth in other tech sectors and this will connect both the physical and digital world. Smart home technology provides users 
                with comfortable living and energy management features as well as reduced user’s workload. When it comes to taking your house into the next level by implementing smart home devices, 
                the easiest way to start is with lighting. I think once the user starts to learn more about smart home technologies by everyday interaction with them, it can lead to future “smart” 
                upgrade. It is good to feel that your house works for your unique preferences.<br>
                Our research assignment was focusing on the usability of the smart lamp using the smart home app that allows to control smart device. In our experiment, we applied principles for 
                usability and HCI design patterns that were introduced to us during HCI lectures.<br>
                The overall experience was positive and as a team, we managed to complete everything on time. What I would do in a different way the next time is to complete tests as earlier as 
                possible, so we could spend more time on analysis. I am glad that I studied HCI paper, it was interesting to learn about how human psychology can affect design patterns and vice 
                versa. I’m also interested in machine learning and advanced HCI technologies which were introduced in the second half of this semester.
