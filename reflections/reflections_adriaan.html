            <p>
                Looking at how the group did overall I feel happy, it was a little difficult at first as we all have quite different timetables our first meeting I had to skip part of 
                my lecture, yet through the power of skype and Facebook messenger we managed to keep up communication, set up future meetings and discuss who’s doing what and when the 
                tests are done.
            </p>

            <p>
                When our group decided the topic of a smart lamp usability test I was a little worried the topic wasn’t deep enough to research and analysis. Yet as the draft testing 
                methods and questions started to develop, it became a topic that gained more interest to me and showed it had depth. Seeing how voice activated lights and 
                remote-controlled lights have been around for a while, it only made sense to investigate a more widely available option for the masses. Where under $100 one could own a 
                smart lamp and bulb with the use of a free app on their phone, control its brightness, colour and its power.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So, the next step was to look at how it compares to a more traditional lamp, was all the technical additives compared to a standard lamp make it more useful and 
                less time consuming? The research and tests were built around this concept could the smart lamp currently replace a normal lamp, would people be happy to do so.
            </p>

            <p>
                I did start to learn a more streamlined, plan forward approach to research, compared to my experience as a in- house IT Engineer, which I was tasked with a similar form 
                of research and tests. Such as trailing out new systems for various parts of the business and warehouses and gathering data from employees about how and what systems 
                could be improved. Producing several pages worth of data and comparisons which I would then propose to the head of IT and COF
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though research wasn’t something I strongly liked or studied into it was part of my job which made it interesting yet having done this paper of HCI beforehand would 
                have had a positive effect on my research documentation and planning. I feel HCI could also be applied to my past part time job of server-side programming, when it came to 
                redesigning portions of their internal warehouse stock website. Asking a few main/ daily users or watching how they use the system to look for improvements
            </p>



            <p>
                With such job experience the course of HCI showed there is a lot more to a system and user, then what I use to think. I would have looked for all and planned around Human 
                computer interaction, having a better idea of which systems to pick over others and which methods would be more effective for the user to grasp and work infectively. This 
                would even hold some grounding over my server-side programming job affecting the way my PHP, HTML, and CSS would have looked and interacted for both the system and the users 
                benefits.
            </p>
