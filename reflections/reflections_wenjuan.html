            <p><strong>Why Smart Lamp?</strong></p>
            
            <p>
                Before choosing the topic of Xiao Mi Smart Lamp usability test, I asked myself which product I have used meets the five characteristics of a usable product – 
                effectiveness, efficiency, engagement, error tolerance and ease of learning. The smart lamp idea came to my mind as its related app allows users control the lamp 
                accurately and fast despite the physical distance. The graphic design of the app makes navigation easy with an obvious lamp icon and clear layout. A simple turn-off 
                click would undo the turn-on and so does the changing brightness according to the current surroundings. Moreover, the learning experience I had on the basic instructions 
                – possibly less than five minutes made it reasonable to define it as a product that matches my existing mental model, which is a representation of something in the real 
                world and how it is done from my perspective.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why did we choose the mixed method?</strong></p>

            <p>
                When it comes to the feedback methods, on the first meeting we considered to use qualitative method as we would like to focus on participants’ responses to open-ended 
                questions in a questionnaire after they have completed scenarios and at the end of the testing session. Later on we changed to adopt a mixed approach because a 
                combination of both quantitative and qualitative collection methods could give us a fuller understanding of the user experience. From both the time taken to turn on a 
                lamp in quantitative tests to the qualitative data gathered through asking for users’ impressions and recommendations for improvement to the lamp or application, the 
                mixed method combined the strength of both methods which provides a good sample size valid for the average data and meanwhile leaves the small number of participants 
                enough time for the detailed and open questions.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What did I learn during the usability test?</strong></p>

            <p>
                The whole team worked on everything together. I was responsible for designing some of the questions as well as analysing part of the data. I learned the idea of “focusing 
                on the user, not the product” during the lecture but did not realize how concrete it could be to put it into practice until we met one of the participants who considered 
                herself good at app using struggled around 20mins to figure the app settings out and manage to control the lamp over app. Since most of the participants spent less than 
                10mins to study the basic instructions and my personal experience was less than five minutes, I did find it unexpected at first but it proved that we would never know the 
                blems users might have until we conduct the usability test. This exactly explains the significance of usability test that no matter how perfect we thought the product is 
                in our own opinion, when the user encounters a problem, there are still improvements we can make in product design.  
            </p>

            <p><strong>What can I improve?</strong></p>
            
            <p>
                The biggest challenge I had was conducting the test and analysing data in a short period of time. Even we formed the group after the mid-semester break, I felt we had 
                enough time for the testing and analysing as we had discussed the outline over the meeting discussion and had a smart lamp ready for testing purpose. Weeks after the 
                meeting we finalized the survey questions and decided the exact methodology but did not set the exact testing date, so the workload was hectic during and after the 
                testing. Also the team can be motivated better if I took the initiative to introduce some interesting facts about smart lamp and smart home devices and suggest to 
                brainstorm the ideas over meeting.
            </p>
			
            <p>
                We managed to look into different aspects of data which led to the conclusion and recommendations. If I was to do this again, I will leave sufficient time for the analysis 
                and conclusion part and give it at least a week to finish the website prior to the deadline so we can focus on the revision and missing points.
            </p>
			
            <p>
                Following the paper, the designing rules and HCI concepts I learned from this paper are straightforward, yet similarly to the practical use of “focusing on the user, not 
                the product”, the best practice to understand these principles is practicing them alongside my career.
            </p>
