            <h3>Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>

            <p>
                The teams goal was to test the usability of the Xiaomi smart lamp and test if it is better and faster to interact with than a standard desktop lamp. The team 
                submitted a hypothesis stating that they believe that the smart lamp will be faster and more accessible to use. The team decided on an Informal qualitative summative
                 set of tests and survey to try and gauge the users impression of the smart lamp and the related mobile application used to manipulate the lamp. The team also gathered 
                 the time that it took to turn on the smart lamps and normal lamps in three different tests.
            </p>
			            
            <p>
                The final consensus is that as the distance from the lamp increases the usefulness of the smart lamp increases means is a users if over 3 meters away from the lamp, then
                 a smart lamp would be helpful and useful. Therefore that the Hypothesis is correct only after 3 Meters or else it is faster to just stand up and turn off the lamp by hand.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The impressions gathered from the subjects is that they were interested in the new technology of a smart lamp however some found that interacting with the Xiaomi Home
                application was hard to learn and understand. Therefore if the application was changed the usefulness and usability of the smart lamp might also increase.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Some user suggestions for making the application more user friendly which can be found at the figure 5 on the data page one of the improvements asks that the application 
                would be better if it provided more instructions to assist less tech sauve users.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The team has had some issues with modelling the tests and If we were to do this test again the team thinks that we would likely consider using a larger sample size with
                 more test subjects even as testing takes 15 to 20 minutes by having 8 to 10 Subjects the outliers would likely affect the averages less.
            </p>
